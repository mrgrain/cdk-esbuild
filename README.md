# cdk-esbuild

_CDK constructs for [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild), an extremely fast JavaScript bundler_

[Getting started](#getting-started) | [Migrating to v2](#migrating-to-v2) |
[Documentation](#documentation) | [API Reference](#api-reference) | [Versioning](#versioning)

## Why?

_esbuild_ is an extremely fast bundler and minifier for Typescript and JavaScript.
This package makes _esbuild_ available to deploy lambda functions, static websites or to publish build artefacts (assets) for further use.

AWS CDK [supports _esbuild_ with Lambda Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-lambda-nodejs-readme.html). However the implementation cannot be used with any other Constructs and doesn't expose all of _esbuild_'s build interface.

This package is running _esbuild_ directly in Node.js and bypasses Docker which the AWS CDK implementation uses. The approach is quicker and easier to use for Node.js users, but incompatible with other languages.

**Production readiness**

This package is generally stable and ready to be used in production, as many do. However _esbuild_ not yet released a version 1.0.0 yet and its API is still in active development. Please check their guide on [production readiness](https://esbuild.github.io/faq/#production-readiness).

Notably upgrades of the _esbuild_ minimum version requirement will be introduced in **minor versions** of this package and will inherit breaking changes from _esbuild_.

## Getting started

Install `cdk-esbuild`:

```
npm install @mrgrain/cdk-esbuild
```

If _peer_ and _optional dependencies_ are not installed automatically (e.g. when using npm v4-6), please use this command to install all of them:

```
npm install @mrgrain/cdk-esbuild esbuild @aws-cdk/core @aws-cdk/aws-lambda @aws-cdk/aws-s3-assets @aws-cdk/aws-s3-deployment @aws-cdk/aws-synthetics
```

### AWS Lambda: Serverless function

> ðŸ’¡ See [Lambda Function](examples/lambda) for a complete working example of a how to deploy a lambda function.

Use `TypeScriptCode` as the `code` of a [lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-lambda.Function.html#code):

```ts
import * as lambda from "@aws-cdk/aws-lambda";
import { TypeScriptCode } from "@mrgrain/cdk-esbuild";

const bundledCode = new TypeScriptCode("src/index.ts");

const fn = new lambda.Function(stack, "MyFunction", {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
  handler: "index.handler",
  code: bundledCode,
});
```

### AWS S3: Static Website

> ðŸ’¡ See [Static Website with React](examples/website) for a complete working example of a how to deploy a React app to S3.

Use `TypeScriptSource` as one of the `sources` of a [static website deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-s3-deployment-readme.html#roadmap):

```ts
import * as s3 from "@aws-cdk/aws-s3";
import * as s3deploy from "@aws-cdk/aws-s3-deployment";
import { TypeScriptSource } from "@mrgrain/cdk-esbuild";

const websiteBundle = new TypeScriptSource("src/index.tsx");

const websiteBucket = new s3.Bucket(stack, "WebsiteBucket", {
  autoDeleteObjects: true,
  publicReadAccess: true,
  removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
  websiteIndexDocument: "index.html",
});

new s3deploy.BucketDeployment(stack, "DeployWebsite", {
  destinationBucket: websiteBucket,
  sources: [websiteBundle],
});
```

### Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics: Canary monitoring

> ðŸ’¡ See [Monitored Website](examples/website) for a complete working example of a deployed and monitored website.

Synthetics runs a canary to produce traffic to an application for monitoring purposes. Use `TypeScriptCode` as the `code` of a Canary test:

```ts
import * as synthetics from "@aws-cdk/aws-synthetics";
import { TypeScriptCode } from "@mrgrain/cdk-esbuild";

const bundledCode = new TypeScriptCode("src/index.ts", {
  buildOptions: {
    outdir: "nodejs/node_modules", // This is required by Synthetics
  },
});

const canary = new synthetics.Canary(stack, "MyCanary", {
  runtime: synthetics.Runtime.SYNTHETICS_NODEJS_PUPPETEER_3_2,
  test: synthetics.Test.custom({
    code: bundledCode,
    handler: "index.handler",
  });
});
```

# Documentation

The package exports various different constructs for use with existing CDK features. A major guiding design principal for this package is to _extend, don't replace_. Expect constructs that you can provide as props, not complete replacements.

For use in **Lambda Functions** and **Synthetic Canaries**, the following classes implement `lambda.Code` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-lambda.Code.html)) and `synthetics.Code` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-synthetics.Code.html)):

- `TypeScriptCode` & `JavaScriptCode`

Inline code is only supported by **Lambda**:

- `InlineTypeScriptCode` & `InlineJavaScriptCode`
- `InlineTsxCode` & `InlineJsxCode`

For use with **S3 bucket deployments**, classes implementing `s3deploy.ISource` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-s3-deployment-readme.html)):

- ðŸ§º `TypeScriptSource` & `JavaScriptSource`

> _Code and Source constructs seamlessly plugin to high-level CDK features. They share the same set of parameters, props and build options._

Underlying classes power the other features. You normally won't have to use them, but they are there if you need them:

- `TypeScriptAsset` & `JavaScriptAsset` implements `s3.Asset` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-s3-assets.Asset.html)) \
  creates an asset uploaded to S3 which can be referenced by other constructs

- `EsbuildBundler` implements `core.BundlingOptions` ([reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_core.BundlingOptions.html)) \
  provides an interface for a _esbuild_ bundler wherever needed

## [API Reference](API.md)

Auto-generated reference for classes and structs. This information is also available within the code completion of your IDE.

## Escape hatches

It's possible that you want to use a implementation of esbuild that's different to the default one. Common reasons are:

- The current version constraints for esbuild are not suitable
- To use version of esbuild that is installed by any other means than `npm`, including Docker
- Plugin support is needed for the building

For these situations, this package offers an escape hatch to bypass regular the implementation and provide a custom build and transform function.

### Custom build function

Constructs that result in starting a build, take a `buildFn` as optional prop. While the defined type for this function is `any`, it must implement the same signature as esbuild's `buildSync` function.

```ts
new TypeScriptCode("fixtures/handlers/ts-handler.ts", {
  buildFn: (options: BuildOptions): BuildResult => {
    try {
      // custom implementation returning BuildResult
    } catch (error) {
      // throw BuildFailure exception here
    }
  },
});
```

Instead of esbuild, the provided function will be invoked with the calculated build options. The custom build function can amend, change or discard any of these. However integration with CDK relies heavily on the values `outdir`/`outfile` are set to and it's usually required to use them unchanged.

Failures have to cause a `BuildFailure` exception in order to be fully handled.

### Custom transform function

Constructs that result in starting a transformation, take a `transformFn` as optional prop. While the defined type for this function is `any`, it must implement the same signature as esbuild's `transformSync` function.

```ts
new InlineTypeScriptCode("let x: number = 1", {
  transformFn: (options: TransformOptions): TransformResult => {
    try {
      // custom implementation returning TransformResult
    } catch (error) {
      // throw TransformFailure exception here
    }
  },,
});
```

Instead of esbuild, the provided function will be invoked with the calculated transform options. The custom transform function can amend, change or discard any of these.

Failures have to cause a `TransformFailure` exception in order to be fully handled.

## Migrating to v2

The main changes in cdk-esbuild v2 are:

- The package is now `jsii` compliant and published in the [Construct Hub](https://constructs.dev/). This will also enable a possible feature release for other languages.
- Deprecated properties and classes have been removed, most notably the previous support for bundling via a Docker container. The implementation had a few issues that cannot be easily resolved. However more generic support for custom executables might arrive in later versions.
- `esbuild` is now installed as an optional dependency. It's not optional at all, but this is a ramification of using `jsii`. In practice this will have no impact on most people.
- Interfaces have been streamlined and the names and setup of internal types have been changed. In the unlikely case that someone was relying on these, upgrading will be straight forward.

### Upgrading

- Update the package dependency to v2: `npm install --save @mrgrain/cdk-esbuild@^2.0.0`
- `esbuild` is now installed as an optional dependency. If your setup does not automatically install optional dependencies, add it as an explicit dependency.
- Remove any use of `bundlerPriority`.
- Experimental construct `EsbuildBundling` has been renamed to `EsbuildBundler` and its interface has slightly changed. Like most other constructs, it now takes `entryPoints` as first parameter, with an optional `props` object as the second.

## Versioning

This package _mostly_ follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), with the exception of upgrades to `esbuild`. These will be released as **minor versions** and often include breaking changes from `esbuild`.

Although great care is taken to avoid this, all features marked with `@stability experimental` may change with minor versions. The flag is only applied to new and experimental features and internal classes.

### Npm Tags

Some users prefer to use tags over version ranges. The following stable tags are available for use:

- `cdk-v1`, `cdk-v2` are provided for the latest release compatible with each version of the AWS CDK.

- `latest` is the most recent stable release.

These tags also exist, but usage is strongly not recommended:

- `unstable`, `next` are used for pre-release of the current and next major version respectively.

- ~~`cdk-1.x.x`~~ tags have been deprecated in favour of `cdk-v1`. Use that one instead.

## Future releases

### AWS CDK v2

The monolithic version 2 of CDK (aka Mono-CDK) is on the horizon. A new major release of this package will be marked alongside CDK. Support for AWS CDK v1.x.x will be continued, however no new features will be added.

### Stable esbuild

Once `esbuild` has reached a stable version 1.0, a new major version will be released for _all_ breaking changes, including updates to minimum (peer) dependencies.

## Library authors

When developing a library consumed by other packages, you'll most likely have to set `buildOptions.absWorkingDir`. The easiest way to do this, is to resolve based on the directory name of the file, and traverse the tree upwards to the root of your library package (that's where `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` are):

```ts
// file: project/src/index.ts
const props = {
  buildOptions: {
    absWorkingDir: path.resolve(__dirname, ".."), // now: /user/project
  },
};
```

This will dynamically resolve to the correct path, wherever the package is installed.
