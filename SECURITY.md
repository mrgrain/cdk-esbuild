# Security Policy

## Report a vulnerability

Please use the form located at **Security** > **Report a vulnerability**.\
See [Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) for detailed instructions.

## Response time expectation

I aim to respond to reported security vulnerabilities within 72h.
However this is an open source project with a single maintainer and life can get in the way.

## Supported versions

Please refer to [VERSIONS.md](./VERSIONS.md) for a complete list of currently supported versions and the support schedule.
