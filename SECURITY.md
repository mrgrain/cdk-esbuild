## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/mrgrain/cdk-esbuild/issues) and add the `security` label.

I strive to respond to security issues within 48h. However this is an open source project with a single maintainer and life can get in the way.

Contributions of secrurity fixes are most welcome!
